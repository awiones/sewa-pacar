- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can access a dashboard to manage listings and reviews.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: Database management system for storing user and girlfriend data.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the website.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
